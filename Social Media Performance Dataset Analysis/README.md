Social Media Analysis Documentation

Project BackGround

Iâ€™ve been given a 2024 dataset capturing detailed records of
post-level performance metrics, platform details, content types,
and geographic reach.
The dataset consolidates information about various posts
published across TikTok, Instagram, LinkedIn, and X.com.
It includes metadata such as post type (video, carousel, text),
content category (product promotion, educational,
entertainment), publishing times, and associated hashtags. It
also tracks performance indicators like engagement, views,
impressions, clicks, click-through rates, and post reach across
countries and regions.
Your goal is to build a report that reveals what makes content
successful on different platforms, explains regional trends in
engagement, and informs better content and platform strategy
decisions
